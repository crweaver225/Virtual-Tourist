## About the App:

Virtual Tourist is an iOS app that allows users to place pins on a map and then view images geolocated to that area on the map.  Gesture recognizers provide an intuitive experience where holding down a finger on a map places a pin in that location. The pins are persisted on the device and when clicked, utilize geolocation and the Flickr api to show relevant images. Images are persisted as well to provide a smooth user experience. 


## Requirements to Use the App:

This app is now written in Swift 3 and works with iOS 10

## Other Things to Know:

- This app uses the Flickr public photos api for the images. 

- Core animations, Core Data, and GCD are used.
